# Patches

All modifications to contributed projects and most modifications to Drupal core must be performed via patches.

## Applying patches

Patches can be applied by referencing them in `composer.json` in the format below. BLT then uses [cweagans/composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) to apply the patches on any subsequent site builds.

Patch information should be specified in the JSON array in accordance with the following schema:

    "extra": {
      "patches": {
        "drupal/core": {
          "Ignore front end vendor folders to improve directory search performance": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/ignore_front_end_vendor-2329453-116.patch",
          "My custom local patch": "./patches/drupal/some_patch-1234-1.patch"
        }
      }
    },

Note that when a package is patched, it's advisable to pin it to a specific version to avoid downloading an updated version that could introduce a patch conflict.

After modifying `composer.json`, run `composer update VENDOR_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME`, replacing `VENDOR_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME` with the name of the patched dependency, e.g.,

    composer update drupal/core

This will apply the patch and update `composer.lock`. Commit the modified `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.

_Alternatively the patch can be applied by running `composer update`. This, however, will update all of the project's dependencies, which may not be desired._

## Storing patches

Patches that can be contributed on Drupal.org should be contributed there. Please follow [Drupal.org's patch naming conventions](https://www.drupal.org/node/1054616#naming-conventions) when creating patches.

Patches that cannot be contributed publicly are extremely rare. In the unlikely event that such a change must be committed, all project-specific patches should reside in this directory. This ensures one consistent place for patches and avoids accidental patch deletion.

Patches should be stored in sub-directories based on project name being patched.

Examples:

- /patches/drupal/some_patch-1234-1.patch
- /patches/ctools/another_patch_name-9876-12.patch

## Gotchas

To update the `.htaccess` (or `robots.txt`) patch follow these steps
```
[make changes to htaccess file]
[copy the entire file contents]
rm patches/htaccess.patch
cd /tmp
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal
cd drupal
mv web docroot
git init
git add docroot/.htaccess
git commit docroot/.htaccess -m 'Initial commit'
[paste modified .htaccess contents from working repo into core Drupal .htaccess file]
git diff docroot/.htaccess > patches/htaccess.patch
git add docroot/.htaccess patches/htaccess.patch
```

(Similar steps for the file at `patches/robotstxt.patch`.)


Alternatively, you could leverage the `post-drupal-scaffold-cmd` script hook to apply patches after Drupal Scaffold is finished. See [this cweagens/composer-patches issue](https://github.com/acquia/blt/issues/1135#issuecomment-285404408) for more details.



Also note that thereâ€™s currently a quirk in the Drupal packaging system that makes it difficult to patch module and theme `.info.yml` files. If you have trouble applying a patch that modifies an info file, see this issue for a description and workaround: https://www.drupal.org/node/2858245
